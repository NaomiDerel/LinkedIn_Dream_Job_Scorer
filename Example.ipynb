So, I kinda just did what I usually do, like posting job ads online and stuff. I didn't really have a plan or anything, just kinda winged it. Anyway, we managed to hire a few folks eventually, but it took longer than expected, and we had to settle for some candidates who weren't exactly what we were looking for. It was kind of a mess, to be honest, and it didn't really have much of an impact on the organization. We got the work done eventually, but it wasn't anything to write home about.\"\n",
